    <h3>Gaurav modi</h3>
    <h4>summary</h4>
    <p>"The Witching Hour" is a bone-chilling horror story that takes place in a small, isolated town on the edge of a
        dark forest. When a group of teenagers decides to play a game of "Bloody Mary" in an abandoned house, they
        unwittingly unleash a malevolent force that threatens to consume them all.
        As the witching hour approaches, strange things start to happen in the town. People begin to disappear, and
        those who remain become increasingly paranoid and suspicious of one another. It soon becomes clear that
        something evil has taken hold of the town, and the only way to stop it is to uncover the truth behind</p>
